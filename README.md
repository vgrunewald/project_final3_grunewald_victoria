* [Quovolver](http://sebnitu.github.io/Quovolver/): This plugin is used to display rovolving quotes or testimonials (as opposed to just short spans of text, like a similar plugin did in my resume project). You can find this plugin in action on my Home page. I use it to rotate through various awards and accolades Pizza Planet has received. 
* [Responsive Tabs](https://github.com/jellekralt/Responsive-Tabs): This plugin displays content in tab form for larger screens and is responsive so that it transforms into an accordion menu for smaller screens. You can see this plugin in action on my Menu page. I used it to display my menu in an organized manner. 
* [bxSlider](http://bxslider.com/): This plugin is a simple and responsive image slider, sliding images horizontally across. I like this slider because it is fairly customizable and easy to use. You can see this plugin in action on my Events page. I use it to display different birthday party themes. 
* [Maplace JS](http://maplacejs.com/): This plugin uses jQuery and Google Maps API to display a section of a Google map with specific points marked based on specified latitude and longitude. You can see this plugin in action on my Contact page. I use it to point out Pizza Planet's "address" for users.

# Comments
* This was definitely a challenging project for me, design-wise. The Pizza Planet aesthetic is much bolder and brighter than I'm used to designing. Challenging, but fun! I think this is the most complete website I've ever built. Thank you for this neat opportunity! 
* Based on the email response I got from you, I did not design the actual order form for my "Order Online" button. I also did not design a page for my "Giftcards" link in the footer. All other buttons and links function accordingly.
